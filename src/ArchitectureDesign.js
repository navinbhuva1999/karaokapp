/**
 * Conceptual Task: Architecture Design for Duet Karaoke Feature
 * 
 * This file contains the architectural design for implementing a real-time duet karaoke feature,
 * which would allow two users to sing together in real-time.
 */

/**
 * REAL-TIME AUDIO SYNCHRONIZATION
 * 
 * To ensure both singers hear the combined output in sync:
 * 
 * 1. Low-Latency WebRTC Connection:
 *    - Establish a direct peer-to-peer connection using WebRTC.
 *    - Use UDP for audio transmission to minimize latency.
 *    - Implement adaptive jitter buffers to handle network fluctuations.
 * 
 * 2. Synchronized Playback:
 *    - Server sends a common timestamp to both clients.
 *    - Clients synchronize their local clocks with the server.
 *    - Background music is played locally on each device, synchronized to the common clock.
 *    - Users' audio is mixed in real-time and transmitted to the other party.
 * 
 * 3. Audio Mixing Strategy:
 *    - Local mixing: Each client mixes their own voice with the received voice.
 *    - Server-side mixing (alternative): Audio streams sent to server, mixed, and redistributed.
 * 
 * 4. Buffer Management:
 *    - Implement small audio buffers (20-50ms) to minimize latency.
 *    - Use adaptive buffer sizes based on network conditions.
 *    - Fall back to larger buffers if network quality is poor.

/**
 * BACKEND INTEGRATION
 * 
 * Data that needs to be exchanged between clients and the server:
 * 
 * 1. Signaling Data:
 *    - WebRTC session establishment parameters (ICE candidates, SDP offers/answers).
 *    - Connection state updates.
 *    - Room/session management information.
 * 
 * 2. Synchronization Data:
 *    - Timestamp references for synchronized playback.
 *    - Beat/measure markers for the karaoke track.
 *    - Latency measurements and adjustment parameters.
 * 
 * 3. Session Data:
 *    - Song selection and preferences.
 *    - User profile information.
 *    - Performance metadata (scores, timing information).
 *    - Session recording options and storage.
 * 
 * 4. Quality Metrics:
 *    - Network performance data.
 *    - Audio quality metrics.
 *    - User experience feedback.

/**
 * CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS
 * 
 * 1. Latency:
 *    - Challenge: Even 100ms latency can disrupt musical synchronization.
 *    - Solution: Use edge servers to minimize physical distance, prioritize audio packets,
 *      employ predictive algorithms to compensate for network delays.
 * 
 * 2. Echo:
 *    - Challenge: Users may hear their own voice echoed back from the other user.
 *    - Solution: Implement echo cancellation algorithms, use audio fingerprinting to
 *      identify and remove echoed audio, ensure users wear headphones.
 * 
 * 3. Network Quality Variations:
 *    - Challenge: Fluctuating bandwidth can cause audio dropouts.
 *    - Solution: Implement adaptive bitrate encoding, graceful degradation of audio quality,
 *      and predictive buffering based on network conditions.
 * 
 * 4. Audio Mixing Complexity:
 *    - Challenge: Real-time mixing of audio streams while maintaining quality.
 *    - Solution: Optimize DSP algorithms for mobile devices, offload complex processing
 *      to server when necessary, process audio in small chunks.
 * 
 * 5. Device Heterogeneity:
 *    - Challenge: Different devices have different audio capabilities and latencies.
 *    - Solution: Device-specific calibration, measure and account for device-specific
 *      audio processing latency, normalize audio levels across different devices.

/**
 * CONCLUSION
 * 
 * The architecture for a real-time duet karaoke feature requires careful consideration of latency,
 * audio quality, and synchronization. By leveraging WebRTC for direct audio transmission and
 * implementing sophisticated synchronization mechanisms, it's possible to create an engaging
 * experience where two users can sing together remotely.
 * 
 * The most critical challenges are minimizing latency and ensuring audio synchronization.
 * These can be addressed through a combination of technical solutions including edge computing,
 * adaptive buffering, and sophisticated audio processing algorithms.
